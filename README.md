# About Borrow
*******************************************************************************


Borrow is a system created for the purpose of tracking borrowed equipment and things that are on loan. The idea is to make an easy to view, easy to add, and easy to remove borrow records in a way that is less cluttered/confusing than a ticketing system.
Borrow was built with HTML5, CSS3, PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.


Borrow currently uses a local development MySQL DB. The current fields will not populate and the PHP will not be active.

If you have any questions or concerns please email kyle.leblanc@hhcc.com
